This project is a static website generated with Hugo (see https://gohugo.io), the static site generator written in Go lang.

It is available only in French. It contains only 2 pages: the index and the news (path is `/actualites`). News are stored in the directory `content/actualites`.

The livrary TailwindCSS version 4 is used to declare and generate CSS. Use Tailwind instead of raw CSS whenever possible.

The rendering is responsive.
